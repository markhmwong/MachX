# Mach X (iOS)
## Release some time on the app store during 2011-2012

## Brief
Tested end of Dec 2018 on iOS 11 written in Obj-C. A working cocos2d game with box2d, this was my second game I made on the Cocos2D framework. I've made this repo to help anyone trying to breathe new life in their old cocos2d game pre-64bit. There's a lot of refactoring and I think cross referencing the cocos2d/box2d files will help you out a lot! I spent multiple days getting it to work, hopefully it'll cut out some much needed hours for you!

Good Luck!
